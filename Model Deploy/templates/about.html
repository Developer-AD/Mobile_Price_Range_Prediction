        </div>
        <p>
          In this project, we are going to explore and analyze a dataset which
          contains specifications of two thousand mobile phones and try to
          predict optimum price ranges for a list of mobile phones in the
          market.During the purchase of mobile phones, various features like
          memory, display, battery, camera, etc., are considered. People fail to
          make correct decisions, due to the non-availability of necessary
          resources to cross-validate the price. To address this issue, a
          machine learning model is developed using the data related to the key
          features of the mobile phone. The developed model is then used to
          predict the price range of the new mobile phone.use the machine
          learning algorithms namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest
          Classifier (RFC), Logistic Regression,Decission Tree,Naive Bayes
          Theorm,K-nearest neighbors are used to train the model and predict the
          output as low, medium, high or very high of price range.

          <span class="heading">Business Problem overview :- </span>
        </div>
        <p>
          In the competitive mobile phone market companies want to understand
          sales data of mobile phones and factors which drive the prices. The
          objective is to find out some relation between features of a mobile
          phoneleg - RAM Internal Memory, etc and its selling price in this
          problem, we do not have to predict the actual price but a price range
          indicating how high the price is ?
          <br />
          AIM :- In this Project,On the basis of the mobile Specification like
          Battery power, 3G enabled , wifi ,Bluetooth, Ram etc we are predicting
          Price range of the mobile

          In project, we looked at classification. Classifiers represent the
          intersection of advanced machine theory and practical application.
          These algorithms are more than just a sorting mechanism for organising
          unlabeled data instances into distinct groupings. Classifiers include
          a unique set of dynamic rules that include an interpretation mechanism
          for dealing with ambiguous or unknown values, all of which are suited
          to the kind of inputs being analysed. Most classifiers also utilise
          probability estimates, which enable end-users to adjust data
          categorization using utility functions. <br />
          1. From EDA we can see that here are mobile phones in 4 price ranges.
          The number of elements is almost similar. <br />
          2. half the devices have Bluetooth, and half don't. <br />
          3. there is a gradual increase in battery as the price range
          increases. <br />
          4. Ram has continuous increase with price range while moving from Low
          cost to Very high cost. 5. costly phones are lighter. <br />
          6. RAM, battery power, pixels played more significant role in deciding
          the price range of mobile phone. <br />
          7. form all the above experiments we can conclude that XGboost
          classifier and linear regression with using hyperparameters we got the
          best results.
